    <h3>Gaming</h3>
    <p>Being raised with two younger brothers unlike others I have
      been around the gaming community and been always facinated by it. But last year my brother introduced me to the really cool FPS game
      i.e. Valorant, from then I've been playing this game.
      And to work on my skills I've joined the college E-sports club.</p>
